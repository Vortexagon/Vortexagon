### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [A hexagonal chess engine, with an AI for it](https://github.com/RealVortexed/Hex-Chess);
  - [A toy project using Markov Chains to predict popular novels](https://github.com/RealVortexed/Markov-TextGen);
  - An abstract syntax tree model, one part of a wider project to build an arithmetic parser.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Rust;
  - Some very basic type theory;
  - The periodic table, off by heart, in moderate detail;
  - Digits of Ï€, off by heart (400 digits memorised so far).
  - Memorising the order of a deck of playing cards, off by heart (can do 18 cards so far).

- âš¡ Fun fact: Python is older than Java.

I love [Zobrist Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zobrist_hashing). Seriously, [bitwise-XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) is beautiful.
